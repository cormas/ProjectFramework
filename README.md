# Description

ProjectFramework is a MIT licensed Open-Source library for project management at application level with Pharo Smalltalk. The ProjectFramework enables to build typical project-based GUI applications, without reinventing the wheel for project-enabled behaviors such as Open, Save, Closing, Versioning, etc. A Spec UI application can be automatically generated from templates with basic menu options very few lines of code.

# Installation

There are several ways to install the **ProjectFramework**. At minimum, you need a working Pharo virtual image installed in your system. Check the [Pharo website](http://www.pharo.org) for installation information regarding the Pharo Open-Source system. Once Pharo is launched you have the following installation options:

- Install a "Core" group which only includes the minimum classes for project manangement.
- Install a "Basic" group which includes the "Core", Pharo specific methods mostly for using the Pharo built-in SettingsFramework, and Spec classes for generating UI with project management operations from templates.
- Install the "Tests" group which includes the "Basic" group.

	" ... "
```

# Usage

## Adding an Application and Project

The ProjectFramework includes a class representing your whole Application. An Application is global to an image - only one application per image could be active at a time - and could contain a single active project or multiple projects. **PFProjectBase** is the basic core (abstract) class for user projects. A custom Project class could be created by inheriting from **PFProjectBase**. Such class will inherit basic project features for example: setting/getting project author, adding/removing project users, owner(s), creation/modification dates, file naming and project history information. Every instantiated project must belong to an application, so the first thing to do is to create an application class:An Application class should inherit from **PFProjectApplication**:s```smalltalkPFProjectApplication subclass: #MyApplicationClass   	instanceVariableNames: ''   	classVariableNames: ''   	package: 'MyApplication-Core'```If there is just one subclass of **PFProjectApplication** then it will be automatically configured and used as the "current application class". Otherwise, you should set up the current application class using the global preferences, for example:```smalltalkPFProjectSettings currentApplicationClass: PFSample1ApplicationClass.``` PFProjectSettings implements customization points in ProjectFramework, so that the Settings Framework might collect them and populate a setting browser with them.The following snippet details how to add your own Project class:```smalltalkPFProjectBase subclass: #MyPFProject   	instanceVariableNames: ''   	classVariableNames: ''   	package: 'MyApplication-Core'```**PFProjectBase** is responsible for implementing owners management, which can be used to authenticate operations on it, authoring, file naming, versioning and history.## Configuring the ApplicationTo link the Application with the Project, we need to add a method to MyApplicationClass in instance side:```smalltalkdefaultProjectClass	" Private - See superimplementor's comment "	^ MyPFProject```You can also configure the application name in class side of MyApplicationClass:```smalltalkapplicationName	" Answer a <String> with receiver's name "		^ 'My First Application'```An user (**PFProjectUser**) represents an user with projects and can instantiate multiple project, however only one will be the active project (#currentProject) at a time for the current application.## A session between an user and a projectOf course an user can create a new project. Projects are identified by name (**String**), and an user cannot have duplicated (with the same name) projects.```smalltalk| usr prj |usr := PFProjectUser named: 'John Perez'.prj := usr addNewProject: 'My First Project'.```And check actually everything was correctly configured:```smalltalkprj authorName.  "'John Perez'"prj projectName. "'My First Project'"```A project can be queried for typical project expected behaviors:```smalltalkprj fileName. "'My First Project.fuelprj'"prj creationDateAsString. "'2018-03-13 01:47:57'"prj saveStatus.  "false"```Projects can also have owners.```smalltalkprj hasOwner.  "false"```And versioning is also supported:```smalltalkprj version: '1.0.0'.prj versionString. "'1.0.0'"```Save the project to file and ask if it was actually saved:```smalltalkprj save.prj saveStatus.```The file name is actually the project name, added with a default "fuelprj" extension, which can be configured later:```smalltalk'My First Project.fuelprj' asFileReference exists.  "true"```> Now moving to an user perspective, the ProjectFramework offers different ways to create projects, depending on specific scenarios.
> Creating and adding projects are two separate things. An user can create a project meaning only instantiating a new **PFProjectBase**, without adding it as part of its projects.
> Adding a project means creating the instance, and adding it to both the application and the collection of user projects.Let's create another project:```smalltalkprj2 := usr createProject: 'My Second Project'.```Check that such project was not added to the user projects yet: ```smalltalkusr hasProjectNamed: 'My Second Project'.```And then we can add it to the user projects:```smalltalkusr addProject: prj2.````> Note that previously we added a project passing its name, and now we use a **PFProjectBase** as parameter.Finally re-check again if it was added correctly: ```smalltalkusr hasProjectNamed: 'My Second Project'.```None of the previosuly message sends set the created project as the current application project. That should be done separately using:```smalltalkprj setCurrentFor: usr.```## Adding a Project Window The Project Framework has built-in support for several types of User-Interfaces. The differences between UI's are that they provide different layouts considering the available underlying widget library. This also provides an abstraction layer for future widget toolkits or libraries (such as Bloc).To add your project window class, use the following snippet:```smalltalkMyAppProjectWindow```Now we need to link your application with your project, add the following instance method in MyAppProjectWindow:```smalltalkapplicationClass	^ MyApplicationClass```Add the following instance methoda in MyAppProjectWindow:```smalltalkprojectClass	" Private - See superimplementor's comment "    	^ MyApplicationProject``````smalltalkcloseAfterCreateProject   	" Answer <true> if receiver's window should close after creation of a project "	^ false```### ProjectFrameworkSpecProjectFrameworkSpec classes inherits from **ComposableModel** (in Pharo 6.x) or **ComposablePresenter** (in Pharo 7.x) and uses the [SpecUIAddOns](https://github.com/hernanmd/SpecUIAddOns) package classes to provide a "standard" layout. The standard project window is based in the Spec **ApplicationWithToolbar** class. Alternatively, a "Project Details" with or without recent projects list layout is also available.Here is a screenshot of both layouts:Classic Layout:![convertidor iso 11784 - senasa 754](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825959/37262532-5fca39d8-2582-11e8-9a0a-c6c0e594a303.png)Recent Projects List Layout:![rehhcg_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825959/37262533-5ffe728e-2582-11e8-85b5-893b2df53171.png)### ProjectFrameworkMorphicThe docking project window is based in the **DockingBarMorph** class, and enables to use the ProjectFramework without Spec (or other higher-level library) dependency.![dockingpfwindow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825959/37263455-0a19abae-2587-11e8-9087-828cdfea3e2d.png)## State MachineProjectFramework uses the [SState](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MasashiUmezawa/SState "SState") package to provide a Finite State Machine managing common project events.## EventsA nice common feature to inform the user of the current project, is to update the title of created or opened projects in the uppermost toolbar. To do this simply implement #defaultWindowTitle to answer a **String** and do not override the #title method.## Custom Application SettingsThe ProjectFramework provides also a class **PFProjectSettingsPharo** (using the Settings Framework of Pharo) to manage configuration of application and project.![pfsettingswindow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825959/37263696-0dfaa75e-2588-11e8-8468-773badd65a8a.png)To use this feature, subclass **PFProjectSettingsPharo** and add the following methods in class side:```smalltalkapplicationClass	" Private - See superimplementor's comment "	^ PFSample1ApplicationClass  ```You will have to create a pragma keyword which you will use in your specific methods with settings code:```smalltalkprojectFrameworkPragmaKeywords	^ Array with: 'projectSample1Settings'```For example a setting to configure the user name of the Application:```smalltalkusernameSettingsOn: aBuilder	<projectSample1Settings>	(aBuilder setting: #usernameSetting)		target: self;		description: 'Set the user name';		label: 'Username';		parent: #projectSettings```## TranslationThe Project Framework currently uses the i18N package to add translation support to menu items and messages. The package I18N was developed by Torsten Bergmann and it is available through SmalltalkHub with the MIT License. The abstract class to check for implementing i18N to your application is **PFTranslator**.PFTranslator adds two catalogs with related project operations. One for english (see #addTranslationsForEN) and another one for spanish (#addTranslationsForES).# Contribute
